This FOTRAN code is to solve the simple Area-Mach realtion in supersonic flow.

* The code is to find the mach number by using the Area as an input
* The iteration method which here is used is Bi-section method
* The limit of Mach number is 1 to 10 (supersonic region)

----------------------------- The Compiling method -----------------------------
* Here i am using gfortran to compile the code
* Here i named the main Fortran file as Area Mach.f90
* run gfortran -c Area Mach.f90
* then run the command run gfortran Name.o -o name.exe (for create the object
and executive file).
* then ./run.exe
